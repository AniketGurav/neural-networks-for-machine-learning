# Answers

###### 1. We often don't know how much data we will need in order for a learning system to generalize well from training data to test data on a given task.
###### True or false: when choosing how much data to give to a learning system in order to make it generalize well, we need to make sure that we don't give it too much data.
A: **False**

###### 2. Data can change over time, in particular we might observe different input/output relationships. In order to account for this we can adapt our learning system to the new data by, for example, training on new examples.

###### If the relationship between inputs and outputs for old examples has not changed, how can we prevent a neural network from forgetting about the old data?

**A - Prevent the system from changing the weights too much.**

B - Ignore the issue and hope that everything will be OK.
    
C - Train two networks, one for old data and one for new data.
    
**D - Train on a mix of old and new data.**

###### 3. Which of the following are good reasons for why we are interested in unsupervised learning?

**A - It allows us to learn from vast amounts of unlabelled data.**

B - It allows academic researchers to publish more papers.

C - It lets us avoid supervised learning entirely.

**D - It can be used to learn features that may help with supervised tasks.**

###### 4. Which of the following tasks are neural networks good at?

A - logical reasoning

**B - Recognizing badly written characters.**

C - Storing lists of names and birth dates.

**D - Recognizing fragments of words in a pre-processed sound wave.**

###### 5. Which number is biggest?
A: **The number of synapes in a human brain.**

###### 6. Which of the following facts provides support for the theory that the local neural circuits in most parts of the cortex all use the same general purpose learning algorithm?

**A - The fine-scale anatomy of the cortex looks pretty much the same all over.**

B - Brain scans show that different functions (like object recognition and language understanding) are located in different parts of the cortex.

**C - If part of the cortex is removed early in life, the function that it would have served often gets relocated to another part of cortex.**

**D - If the visual input is sent to the auditory cortex of a newborn ferret, the "auditory" cells learn to do vision.**
